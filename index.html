          Everyday, the world changes, people protest in the streets as well as on social media, and hashtag hijacking has become one of their strongest weapons. But how can we make it even better? How can we choose the most efficient hashtag?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, it’s easy to say that on Twitter, hashtags are real protagonists. They are tags for the topic of conversation, and finding the most efficient one is crucial to participate in the discussion. And here’s where the trending section comes
          in handy: a selection of the most popular hashtags at any specific time, depending on the number of tweets and the level of engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          When something remarkable happens, however, people may use different hashtags to discuss the same topic. The various hashtags may become more or less popular, according to the way users mention them in their posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in the case of the White lives matter movement boycott, many hashtags were used, but eventually, only one proved to be the most efficient. Then, the real question is: how did the activists know which one to use?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s take a step back. Despite social distancing, in 2020 people still protested in the streets and, this spring, one hopeful message raised above all: that black lives matter. This community needed people to listen, and to support them,
          social media did the opposite of what they usually do: they blacked out, in sign of respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, not everyone was glad to stay silent. White supremacists decided to challenge the BLM movement, flooding Twitter with white posts, using different hashtags to state that White Lives matter as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But their action did not go unnoticed. An army of kpop fans decided to boycott these hashtags, filling their feeds with unrelated contents. In particular, they favored the whitelivesmatter hashtag, the most popular one among all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to massive participation in the hijacking, this hashtag trended on Twitter, turning into yet another element of protest for the black lives matter movement.
          It went from an individual choice to a powerful collective action!
        </p>
        <p>
          The fans used footage from kpop concerts, better known as fancams, to flood Twitter feeds, but humor also had a big part in the hijacking. Someone also carried out a critical commentary of the event, but eventually all the posts aimed to
          disrupt the original message.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of June, over 94000 (?) posts with the hashtag WhiteLivesMatter were uploaded on Twitter, and the majority was hijacked. The protest was surely a success.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let’s go back to our question. How can we find the most efficient hashtag? How did the kpop stans manage to reach such a big success? The key is “going with the flow!”. Follow the most popular hashtags and take part in the collective
          action!
